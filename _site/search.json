    "text": "This project is about the dynamic concepts of economics, to chart the course of global GDP growth rates from the years 1999 to 2022. Because of RStudio, it is possible to transform raw data into a narrative that reflects past economic trends, as well as help in forecasting future possibilities. The graphs below are visualizations that bring clarity to economics that may seem complex, making them accessible to anyone. An observation that can be made is that the countries with the highest change in GDP over 23 years are China and the United States."

    "text": "Bar Graphs\nA bar graph consists of “boxes” that are designed to display the value of a country, but only for a specific year. Below are two bar graphs that show the values of five different countries at different points of time. An advantage of this is that it is easier to read than the line plot. However, this graph does come with some disadvantages. For one, if we look at the line plot, we can view GDP points for all the years in the dataset at once. Here, we can only see the values of one specific year at a time, rather than all the years in our dataset. Another drawback of the bar graph, as well as the line plot, is that we can only see a few select countries instead of all the countries in the dataset. What if I wanted to see the GDP of all the countries at once?"

In the examples below, we can see a different color represents a different range of GDP values. Here, we can view all the countries, instead of just a few like in the line plots and bar graphs. The only disadvantage of the chloropleth map, is that, similar to the bar graphs, we can only see the data for one specific year, and not all the years. This can also be useful sometimes, if we want to look at only one year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see can see another Chloropleth map, but for the year 2022."
