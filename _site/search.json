Because of RStudio, it is possible to transform raw data into a narrative that reflects past economic trends, as well as help in forecasting future possibilities. The graph below is a visualizations which brings clarity to economics that may seem complex, making them accessible to anyone. The countries with the highest change in GDP over 23 years are China and the United States."

    "text": "Bar Graphs\nA bar graph consists of “boxes” that are designed to display the value of a country. Below are two bar graphs that show the values of five different countries at different points of time. An advantage of this is that it is easier to read than the line plot. However, a disadvantage compared to the line plot is that we can only see the values of one specific year at a time, rather than all the years in our dataset."

In the examples below, we can see a different color represents a different range of GDP values. Here, we can view all the countries, instead of just a few. The only disadvantage however, is that, similar to the bar graphs, we can only see the data for one specific year, and not all the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see can see another Chloropleth map, but of the year 2022."
